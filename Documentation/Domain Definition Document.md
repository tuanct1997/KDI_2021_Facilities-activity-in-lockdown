Covid-19 – the disease that changed the way humans will live forever. We could have never imagined a world where everything is closed, where we have to do everything from a distance, or a world where we only have anti-social interactions. Throughout history, mankind has never had to face this kind of crisis. We have never been prepared for this situation. At this time of crisis, mankind feels confused and doesn’t know how to deal with the pandemic while improving the economy. So, this project’s been created to analyze the pandemic’s life, specially in Trento. With this study we hope we can explore different aspects of our pandemic’s life so from that, mankind could be well prepared if we ever face this situation once again. For the scope of the project, we consider the Trento city’s facilities as an environment where we can integrate heterogeneous data about the university students’ behavior during the lockdown period caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This project focuses on the facilities’ point of view in order to analyze all the relevant Domain of Interest (DOI).
